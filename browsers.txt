!!! Put the full path to the browser binary in this file, here are a few examples:

C:\Program Files\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe

!!! You can leave empty lines for organization, just be sure that they are really empty
!!! You also need to define a link that will be open in those browsers
